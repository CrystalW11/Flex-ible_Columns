## Part II
Using the **HTML** provided below and *reusing* the `.row` and `.col` classes from before, create a .`col-2` class inside of our **CSS**. We want it to appear as a **1/3 of the space box** and a **2/3 of the space box.**

## Part III
Using the **HTML** provided below and *reusing* the `.row` and `.col-2`, classes from before, create a `.col-3` class inside of our **CSS**. We want it to appear as a layout with a **2/5 of the space box and a 3/5 of the space box.**
